# UnitfulPlots

Enables automatic labeling of units on axes of plots generated with
[Plots.jl](http://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl). The unitful quantities are
created in the first place using
[Unitful.jl](http://github.com/ajkeller34/Unitful.jl).

To use, simply type `using UnitfulPlots` in Julia 0.5 or higher
and plot arrays of quantities as you usually would.

This package is experimental, please report unexpected behavior.
